2. Data types
	null
	underfined
	boolean
	number
	string 
	object (Array ..)
	sysbol

3. Ex
<script>
 //demo
 alert('hello');

 var a =2;
 var b = 'a';
 var c =a+b;

</script>




1. Difference 
	
	var a = function(){

	}


	function hello(){
		
	}
	


The difference is that functionhello is a function expression and so only defined when that line is reached, whereas functionTwo is a function declaration and is defined as soon as its surrounding function or script is executed
